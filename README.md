# Heathrow Pollution Study

⚠️🚧This is an initial **rough draft**. ⚠️🚧

The study protocol has gaps, but serves as guidance for the initial exploration of what is possible using readily available open data.

### Study Objective
Quantify the correlation between aircraft landing activity and pollution at existing ground-level Air Quality Monitors (AQMs).

### Research Question
To what extent do ground-level AQMs near Heathrow flight path detect pollution attributable to aircraft landings?

### Hypothesis
We hypothesise that periods of high aircraft landing traffic are significantly correlated with elevated ground-level concentrations of PM2.5 and PM10, controlling for road traffic pollution and meteorological factors.

## Variables

**Primary variables**

The study will first look into the effect of the primary variables below. If the correlation coefficient is low, we will use utilise the secondary variables in study.

| Primary variable  | Type        | Description                                                                                                            |
| ----------------- | ----------- |------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| Aircraft altitude | Independent | Affects pollution dispersion and influences how much pollution reaches the ground                              |
| AQM location      | Control     | Distance (vertical and horizontal) to flight path determine how much pollution is measured                     |
| Road traffic      | Control     | Affects pollution readings independently of aircraft. Needs to be accounted, so it's not attributed to aircraft emissions |

**Secondary variables**

These are all weather measurements that can affect how pollution dissipates in the atmosphere and influence how it is measured on the ground.

| Variable             | Type    | Description                                                                                               |
| -------------------- | ------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Atmospheric pressure | Control | Can affect emissions dispersion                                              |
| Rain                 | Control | Can affect pollutant removal from atmosphere                                                              |
| Wind direction/speed | Control | Can affect direction of dispersion (e.g., if an AQM is located "upwind" it won't likely measure emissions) |

Wind is a challenging variable to control because speed and direction can change depending on altitude. This dissipates pollution horizontally and vertically in ways that is complex to predict at ground level.

**Uncontrolled variables**

There are other variables that may be impossible to control due to scarcity of data. The following are likely factors in the amount of pollution generated by aircraft, but are not controlled in this study:

- Aircraft/turbine model, age and state of maintenance
- Aircraft total weight
- Quality of fuel

#### AQM Location

We are interested in measuring the amount of pollution in aircraft landings, not take-offs, because:
- all aircraft follow a predetermined path as they approach the airport
- aircraft fly over London in relatively low altitude for a prolonged amount of time

However, aircraft will not always approach the airport from the same "side" and land at the same runway. Wind direction (at 600m) and a runway schedule dictates which runway is in use at any give time. So we need to model Heathrow's runway operations.

**Runway operations at Heathrow**

Heathrow has two runways (north and south) that are used as follows.

- **Easterly operations**: when wind blows from the east, aircraft approach from the west. The South runway is always used.
- **Westerly operations**: when wind blows form the west, aircraft approach from the east (flying over London). In this configuration, either the North or South runways is in use, depending on a schedule.

The airport operates a Westerly service 70% of the time, as follows:

|                           | 05:00-15:00 | 15:00-23:00 |
|---------------------------| ----------- | ----------- |
| **Westerly** <br>  week 1 | Northern    | Southern    |
| **Westerly** <br>  week 2 | Southern    | Northern    |
| **Easterly**              | Southern    | Southern    |

It is possible to identify which runway was operating based on the official schedule programme and confirming it based on historical wind directions.

#### AQM Selection Criteria

- Horizontal distance to landing flight path
- Horizontal distance to airport
 
#### Selected AQMs

- There are no AQMs that fit the selection criteria.

AQMs to the east of Heathrow:

- *Richmond upon Thames - Richmond*
- *Wandsworth Battersea*

#### Road Traffic

Road traffic follows a cyclical approach depending on day (e.g., Christmas), day of the week (e.g., Sunday or Monday), and hour of day.

**Within day**, road traffic follows a regular pattern around commuting time. For example, we can use the openly published peak times of the London underground as proxy for road traffic and compare to the airport operating times. For example:

|               | Events             | Road Traffic | Air Traffic |
| ------------- |--------------------| ------------ | --------- |
| 00:00 - 05:00 |                    | low🔹        | --🔹      |
| 05:00 - 07:00 | 05:00 first landing | low🔹        | high🔹    |
| 07:00 - 09:15 | 07:00 peak commute | high         | high      |
| 09:15 - 17:45 |                    | mid          | high      |
| 17:45 - 19:45 | 17:45 peak commute | high         | high      |
| 19:45 - 23:00 | 23:00 last landing | low🔹        | high🔹    |
| 23:00 - 23:59 |                    | low          | --        |

This makes it possible to compare pollution measurements, for example, at 4am (low road, no aircraft) against 5am or 6am (low road, high aircraft).

## Methodology

This is an **observational, time-series correlational study** using secondary data from multiple public sources.

### Study Design

#### Setup 1: AQM Under Flight Path
Compare pollution data from the closest AQM to the flight path, against different times of the same day, to identify aircraft as significant source of pollution.

We are controlling for:
- Road traffic: variation within the same day
- AQM location: directly **under** the flight path

![Setup 1: AQM Under Flight Path](https://github.com/fapomar/heathrow-pollution-study/blob/main/docs/LHR-StudySetup_1.jpg)


#### Setup 2: AQM Downwind of Flight Path
Compare pollution data from the furthest AQM to the flight path **downwind**, against different times of the same day, to identify aircraft as significant source of pollution. We'll control for wind direction at ground level.

We are controlling for:
- Road traffic: variation within the same day
- AQM location: **downwind** from flight path

## Conclusion

Work In Progress

Sample output data structure:

| PM10       | 04:00 | 05:00 | 06:00 | 07:00 | 08:00 |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2025-03-01 | 30    | 35    | 41    | 59    | 55    |
| 2025-03-02 | 27    | 33    | 37    | 34    | 49    |
| 2025-03-02 | 31    | 34    | 38    | 40    | 50    |

## Study Limitations
A future research could look at comparing pollution data across different days; for example, a workday Monday against a school holiday Monday whilst controlling for cofounding variables (i.e., only days with similar meteorological conditions)
