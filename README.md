# Heathrow Pollution Study

‚ö†Ô∏èüöß This study protocol is incomplete and a bit rough, but it provides some structure for running preliminary data analysis

### Study objective
Quantify the correlation between aircraft landing activity and pollution at existing ground-level Air Quality Monitors (AQMs).

### Research question
To what extent do ground-level AQMs near the LHR landing flight path detect pollution attributable to aircraft landings?

### Hypothesis
We hypothesise that periods of high aircraft landing traffic are significantly correlated with elevated ground-level concentrations of NOx, PM2.5, and PM10 at ground level, controlling for road traffic and meteorological factors.

### Terminology
- AQM: air quality monitors are devices at ground level that measure pollutants
- Landing path: is the pre-determined path aircrafts must follow in the sky as they approach the airport to touchdown
- Westerly operations: airport configuration in which the wind blow to the East and aircrafts approach the airport from the East

### Variables

**Primary variables**
The study will first look into the effect of the primary variables below. If the correlation coefficient is low, we will use utilise the secondary variables in study.

| Primary variable  | Type        | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Aircraft altitude | Independent | Affects pollution dispersion and directly influences how much pollution reaches the ground                                |
| AQM location      | Control     | AQM location - that is, vertical and horizontal distance to flight path - determine how much pollution is measured        |
| Road traffic      | Control     | Affects pollution readings independently of aircraft. Needs to be accounted, so it's not attributed to aircraft emissions |

**Secondary variables**
These are all weather measurements that can affect how pollution dissipates in the atmosphere and influence how it is measured on the ground.

| Variable             | Type    | Description                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Atmospheric pressure | Control | Can affect emissions dispersion, especially high pressure                                                  |
| Rain                 | Control | Can affect pollutant removal from atmosphere                                                              |
| Wind direction/speed | Control | Can affect direction of dispersion (e.g., an AQM located "upwind" is is less likely measure emissions) |

Wind is a complex variable to control because speed and direction can change depending on altitude. This dissipates pollution horizontally and vertically in ways that is complex to predict.

**Uncontrolled variables**
There are other variables that may be impossible to control due to scarcity of data. The following are likely factors in the amount of pollution generated by aircrafts, but are not controlled in this study:

- Aircraft/turbine model, age and state of maintenance
- Aircraft total weight
- Quality of fuel

#### AQM location

We are interested in measuring the amount of pollution in aircraft landings, not take off, because:
- all aircrafts follow a predetermined path as they approach the runway
- aircrafts fly over London in relatively low altitude for a prolonged amount of time

For context, it's important to understand the runway operations at London Heathrow.

LHR operates a runway alteration programme that runs in a two week cycle when operating a westerly service (70% of time). This yearly programme is published by the airport, and its aim is to give local communities respite to noise pollution.

|                           | 05:00-15:00 | 15:00-23:00 |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Westerly**  week 1 | Northern    | Southern    |
| **Westerly**  week 2  | Southern    | Northern    |
| **Easterly**              | Southern    | Southern    |

There is no publicly available historical data on runway operations at Heathrow. However, it is possible to infer which runway was in use for a given day by examining the runway programme and historical wind directions (to confirm actual operations).

###### Selection Criteria
1. AQMs historical data is free and retrievable
2. Horizontal distance to landing flight path
3. Horizontal distance to runway
###### Selected AQMs
AQMs historical data is free and retrievable:
- We will use data from [London Air Quality Network](https://www.londonair.org.uk/london/asp/publicdetails.asp)

Horizontal distance to landing flight path and runway:
- There are no AQMs to the west of LHR that fit the selection criteria. So, we are limited to those to the East of the airport.

Details of AQMs that adhere to Selection Criteria:

#### Road Traffic
Road traffic follows a cyclical approach that follows day of the week and hour of day, but also whether it's a regular working day or not - for example, school holidays are notorious for having less cars on the road.

Within day:

Road traffic follows a regular pattern around commuting time. For example, we can use the openly published peak times of the London underground as proxy for road traffic. For example:

|                   | Events              | Road Traffic | Air Traffic |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 00:00 - 05:00     | 05:00 first landing | lowüîπ        | ----üîπ      |
| 05:00 - 07:00 |                     | lowüîπ        | highüîπ      |
| 07:00 - 09:15     | Rush hour    | high         | high        |
| 09:15 - 17:45 |                     | mid          | high        |
| 17:45 - 19:45     | Rush hour    | high         | high        |
| 19:45 - 23:00 | 23:00 last landing  | lowüîπ        | highüîπ      |
| 23:00 - 23:59     |                     | low          | --          |

_Note to self: checkout data.gov.uk for direct data about road traffic peak times_

This makes it possible to compare pollution measurements, for example, at 4am (low road, no air) against 5am or 6am (low road, high air).

Outside of the scope of this study protocol, another study could look at comparing pollution data across different days; for example, a workday Monday against a school holiday Monday whilst controlling for cofounding variables (i.e., only days with similar meteorological conditions)

## Methodology

This is an **observational, time-series correlational study** using secondary data from multiple public sources.

### Study design

#### Setup 1

Compare pollution data from the closest AQM to the flight path, against different times of the day, to identify aircraft as significant source of pollution.

We are controlling for:
- Road traffic: variation within the same day
- AQM location: directly under the flight path

Data structure example:

| PM10       | 04:00 | 05:00 | 06:00 | 07:00 | 08:00 |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2025-03-01 | 30    | 35    | 41    | 59    | 55    |
| 2025-03-02 | 27    | 33    | 37    | 34    | 49    |
| 2025-03-02 | 31    | 34    | 38    | 40    | 50    |


#### Setup 2

Compare pollution data from the furthest AQM to the flight path downwind, against different times of the day, to identify aircraft as significant source of pollution. We'll control for wind direction at ground level.

![Study setup diagram](https://github.com/fapomar/heathrow-pollution-study/blob/main/docs/LHR-StudySetup_2.jpg?raw=true)

We are controlling for:
- Road traffic: variation within the same day
- AQM location: downwind from flight path
