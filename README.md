# Heathrow Pollution Study

‚ö†Ô∏èüöß The study protocol lacks rigour but serves as guidance for the initial exploration of what is possible using readily available open data.

### Study objective
Quantify the correlation between aircraft landing activity and pollution at existing ground-level Air Quality Monitors (AQMs).

### Research question
To what extent do ground-level AQMs near the LHR landing flight path detect pollution attributable to aircraft landings?

### Hypothesis
We hypothesise that periods of high aircraft landing traffic are significantly correlated with elevated ground-level concentrations of NOx, PM2.5, and PM10 at ground level, controlling for road traffic and meteorological factors.

### Terminology
- AQM: air quality monitors are devices at ground level that measure pollutants
- Landing path: is the pre-determined path aircrafts must follow in the sky as they approach the airport to touchdown
- Westerly operations: airport configuration in which the wind blow to the East and aircrafts approach the airport from the East
- Runway: LHR has two runways north and south see below

### Variables

**Primary variables**
The study will first look into the effect of the primary variables below. If the correlation coefficient is low, we will use utilise the secondary variables in study.

| Primary variable  | Type        | Description                                                                                                               |
| ----------------- | ----------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Aircraft altitude | Independent | Affects pollution dispersion and directly influences how much pollution reaches the ground                                |
| AQM location      | Control     | AQM location - that is, vertical and horizontal distance to flight path - determine how much pollution is measured        |
| Road traffic      | Control     | Affects pollution readings independently of aircraft. Needs to be accounted, so it's not attributed to aircraft emissions |

**Secondary variables**
These are all weather measurements that can affect how pollution dissipates in the atmosphere and influence how it is measured on the ground.

| Variable             | Type    | Description                                                                                                |
| -------------------- | ------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Atmospheric pressure | Control | Can affect emissions dispersion, especially high pressure                                                  |
| Rain                 | Control | Can affects pollutant removal from atmosphere                                                              |
| Wind direction/speed | Control | Can affect direction of dispersion (e.g., if an AQM is located "upwind" it won't likely measure emissions) |

Wind is a complex variable to control because speed and direction can change depending on altitude. This dissipates pollution horizontally and vertically in ways that is complex to predict.

**Uncontrolled variables**
There are other variables that may be impossible to control due to scarcity of data. The following are likely factors in the amount of pollution generated by aircrafts, but are not controlled in this study:

- Aircraft/turbine model, age and state of maintenance
- Aircraft total weight
- Quality of fuel

#### AQM location

We are interested in measuring the amount of pollution in aircraft landings, not take off, because:
- all aircrafts follow a predetermined path as they approach the airport
- aircrafts fly over London in relatively low altitude for a prolonged amount of time

Furthermore, it's important to understand the runway operations at LHR.

LHR operates a runway alteration programme that runs in a two week cycle when operating a westerly service (70% of time). This yearly programme is published by the airport, and its aim is to give local communities respite to noise pollution.

|                           | 05:00-15:00 | 15:00-23:00 |
| ------------------------- | ----------- | ----------- |
| **Westerly** <br>  week 1 | Northern    | Southern    |
| **Westerly**<br>  week 2  | Southern    | Northern    |
| **Easterly**              | Southern    | Southern    |

It is possible to identify which runway is operating for landing based on the schedule programme and historical wind directions (to confirms if the window is blowing from the west).

#### Road Traffic
Road traffic follows a cyclical approach that follows day of the week and hour of day, but also whether it's a regular working day or not - for example, school holidays are notorious for having less cars on the road.

**Within day**
Road traffic follows a regular pattern around commuting time. For example, we can use the openly published peak times of the London underground as proxy for road traffic. For example:

|                   | Events              | Road Traffic | Air Traffic |
| ----------------- | ------------------- | ------------ | ----------- |
| 00:00 - 05:00     | 05:00 first landing | lowüîπ        | ----üîπ      |
| 05:00 - 07:00 |                     | lowüîπ        | highüîπ      |
| 07:00 - 09:15     | Rush hour Balham    | high         | high        |
| 09:15 - 17:45 |                     | mid          | high        |
| 17:45 - 19:45     | Rush hour Balham    | high         | high        |
| 19:45 - 23:00 | 23:00 last landing  | lowüîπ        | highüîπ      |
| 23:00 - 23:59     |                     | low          | --          |

To Do: checkout data.gov.uk for direct data about road traffic peak times

This makes it possible to compare pollution measurements, for example, at 4am (low road, no air) against 5am or 6am (low road, high air).

Outside of the scope of this study protocol, a researcher could look at comparing pollution data across different days; for example, a workday Monday against a school holiday Monday whilst controlling for cofounding variables (i.e., only days with similar meteorological conditions)
## Methodology

This is an **observational, time-series correlational study** using secondary data from multiple public sources.

### Study design

#### Setup 1

Compare pollution data from the closest AQM to the flight path, against different times of the day, to identify aircraft as significant source of pollution.

We are controlling for:
- Road traffic: variation within the same day
- AQM location: directly under the flight path

Data structure example:

| PM10       | 04:00 | 05:00 | 06:00 | 07:00 | 08:00 |
| ---------- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- | ----- |
| 2025-03-01 | 30    | 35    | 41    | 59    | 55    |
| 2025-03-02 | 27    | 33    | 37    | 34    | 49    |
| 2025-03-02 | 31    | 34    | 38    | 40    | 50    |


#### Setup 2

Compare pollution data from the furthest AQM to the flight path downwind, against different times of the day, to identify aircraft as significant source of pollution. We'll control for wind direction at ground level.

LHR runways do not follow a perfect West-East path, it's slightly angled. This means that the wind of interest is not, for example, North-South, but this variable needs to be slightly adjusted to be perpendicular to the flight path

We are controlling for:
- Road traffic: variation within the same day
- AQM location: downwind from flight path

Your study protocol is quite detailed and well thought out‚Äîstrong overall. That said, I‚Äôll walk through a **structured critique** and highlight a few **strengths**, **flaws or gaps**, and **recommendations for improvement**, grouped by area.
